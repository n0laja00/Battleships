Ships are placed randomly on the board with random orientations. You as the captain can shoot any cell you wish on the grid. 
Upon shooting, you will either hit or miss. After this, the game will print the remaining number of enemy ships, regardless if it was a hit or miss. 
The game will also calculate all the possible placements of the ships on board, excluding the ships whose position is known.
If you hit a ship 2 times, the game will inform you if the ship you shot is vertically or horizontally aligned.
